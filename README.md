# NVC MCP Server

Nonviolent Communication tools for any LLM — via MCP or a copy-paste prompt.

Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is a way of talking and listening that focuses on what we observe, feel, and need — instead of blaming, judging, or demanding. Created by Marshall Rosenberg, it helps us connect with ourselves and others so that our natural compassion can come through. This project brings NVC into your everyday conversations with AI. If you're new to NVC, [this practical guide](https://www.dave-bailey.com/blog/nonviolent-communication) is a great place to start.

## Pick Your Path

### MCP users (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

1. Open your app's settings file (in Claude Desktop it's called `claude_desktop_config.json`)
2. Paste the following block into it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nvc": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["non-violent-communicator"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Save the file and restart the app

That's it. No API keys, no internet connection needed. You now have 4 NVC tools and a browsable knowledge base.

### Claude Code users

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/christoph-leitenberger/non-violent-communicator.git`
2. Open the folder in Claude Code

It just works — the repo already includes the right settings file, so the NVC tools are ready to use.

### Any LLM (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) — no install needed

1. Open **[this prompt file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christoph-leitenberger/non-violent-communicator/master/PROMPT.md)**
2. Select all the text and copy it
3. Paste it as the first message in any LLM chat

Done — your LLM is now an NVC assistant with all four tools.

## What You Get

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Thought Clarifier** | Paste any raw thought, rant, or journal entry — get a structured NVC breakdown (observations, feelings, needs, request) |
| **Message Transformer** | Rewrite a difficult email, chat message, or feedback using NVC principles |
| **NVC Trainer** | Practice identifying observations, feelings, needs, and requests with interactive exercises (3 difficulty levels) |
| **Political Discourse** | Analyze political quotes through the NVC lens — surface life-alienating patterns and the human needs behind the rhetoric |

### Why Political Discourse?

Politicians often use aggressive, blaming, or vague language. This makes it hard to see what they actually want and whose needs they're serving. The Political Discourse tool strips away the rhetoric and shows you the real human needs hiding underneath.

Imagine if politicians had to say clearly what they need — without distracting, blaming, or attacking. That's what this tool does: it translates political speech into honest, human language.
