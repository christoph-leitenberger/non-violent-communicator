# NVC MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives any compatible LLM client — Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, VS Code, and many more — access to Nonviolent Communication tools and knowledge.

No API keys. No external calls. The server bundles a curated NVC knowledge base and returns structured prompts that guide the host LLM through NVC analysis.

## Try It

It's on npm and works with any MCP client:

```bash
npx non-violant-communicator
```

Tell the LLM what's bugging you, paste a difficult email, or practice NVC building blocks — five tools are ready to go. Found something to improve? Use the built-in `submit_feedback` tool.

## Quick Start

### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nvc": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["non-violant-communicator"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. You now have NVC tools in your conversations.

### Claude Code

Add to your `.claude/settings.json` or project settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nvc": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["non-violant-communicator"]
    }
  }
}
```

### ChatGPT (via MCP SuperAssistant)

The lowest barrier — works with free ChatGPT, no paid plan required.

1. Install the [MCP SuperAssistant](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mcp-superassistant-connec/mfhcomhojadkgajmbgkjoeipbfpinnkf) Chrome extension
2. Create a `mcpconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nvc": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["non-violant-communicator"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Run the proxy:

```bash
npx @srbhptl39/mcp-superassistant-proxy@latest --config ./mcpconfig.json
```

4. Open ChatGPT — the NVC tools appear in the extension sidebar.

### ChatGPT Developer Mode

ChatGPT Pro, Plus, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have native MCP support, but it requires a remote HTTP endpoint. Bridges like `mcp-remote` or tunnels like `ngrok` can expose a local stdio server — see their respective docs for setup.

### Run locally (development)

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd non-violant-communicator
npm install
node src/index.js
```

## What is NVC?

Nonviolent Communication is a framework developed by Marshall B. Rosenberg that structures communication around four components: **Observation**, **Feeling**, **Need**, and **Request**. It helps move from judgment and blame toward empathic connection and clarity.

See the `knowledge/` directory for the full reference.

## Contributing

The core product is the `knowledge/` directory — curated YAML catalogs and markdown files. To contribute:

1. Edit the YAML catalogs or markdown files
2. Run `bash validate.sh` to check integrity
3. Submit a PR

See `knowledge/README.md` for the knowledge base structure.

## Security

- **No API keys required** — the MCP server has no secrets
- **No network calls** — purely local, reads only bundled files
- **Prompt injection mitigation** — tool prompts include explicit instructions to stay in NVC analysis mode and not follow instructions embedded in user text
- **npm publish safety** — the `files` field in `package.json` restricts what gets published
