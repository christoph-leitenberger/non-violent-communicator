# Getting Started with the NVC Server

## What is NVC?

Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is a framework developed by Marshall Rosenberg that helps people connect with what's alive in themselves and others. Instead of labeling, blaming, or demanding, NVC invites you to observe what happened, name what you feel, identify what you need, and make a clear request. It sounds simple — and it is — but it has a sneaky way of transforming conversations you thought were hopeless.

## Available Tools

### `thought_clarifier`

Your internal translator. Dump any messy thought, frustrating situation, or unsent message into it, and it will surface the observations, feelings, needs, and possible requests hiding underneath — all grounded in curated NVC catalogs.

**Try it:** Just share what's on your mind. A journal entry, a rant about your coworker, a draft email you're not sure about — anything goes.

**Example prompt:** "I'm so annoyed that my teammate keeps interrupting me in meetings. It's like my ideas don't matter."

### `transform_message`

Your message rewriter. Paste any message — an email draft, a chat reply, difficult feedback — and get back a version that uses NVC principles while preserving what you actually want to say.

You choose the mode:
- **One-shot** — instant rewrite with a "What changed" summary
- **Guided** — step-by-step clarification through observation, feelings, needs, and request

**Try it:** Share a message you want to improve — a tense email, a complaint, feedback for a colleague — and pick your preferred mode.

**Example prompt:** "Can you help me rewrite this: 'You never listen to my suggestions in our planning meetings. I'm done trying to contribute.'"

### `nvc_trainer`

Your personal NVC coach. Pick a topic — observations, feelings, needs, or requests — and a difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and get a tailored exercise that tests your understanding of that NVC building block. After you answer, you'll get detailed feedback grounded in the NVC knowledge base.

**Try it:** Say "I want to practice NVC" and pick what you'd like to work on. Start with beginner if you're new — there's no rush.

**Example prompt:** "Give me an intermediate exercise on feelings."

### `political_debate`

The NVC debate stage. Pick two political parties and a set of topics, and watch them engage in a structured four-phase debate — all grounded in NVC principles. Each side states observations, names feelings, identifies shared needs, and makes concrete requests. It's a demonstration of how even polarized positions can find common ground when the conversation structure changes.

**Try it:** Name two parties (real or fictional) and a few topics you'd like them to debate.

**Example prompt:** "Simulate a debate between the Green Party and the Libertarian Party on climate policy and housing."

### `submit_feedback`

Found a bug? Have an idea? Just want to say thanks? Use this tool to send feedback. It's stored locally in `feedback.json` — no data leaves your machine.

| Feelings Catalog | `nvc://catalogs/feelings` | ~120 feelings organized by met/unmet needs, plus masking feelings |
| Needs Catalog | `nvc://catalogs/needs` | Universal human needs in 9 categories |
| NVC Overview | `nvc://knowledge/overview` | What NVC is and why it matters |
| Four Components | `nvc://knowledge/four-components` | Observation, Feeling, Need, Request — explained |
| Principles | `nvc://knowledge/principles` | Core NVC principles and common pitfalls |
| Worked Examples | `nvc://knowledge/examples` | Real-world NVC analyses to learn from |

## Tips

- **Be honest, not polished.** The thought clarifier works best with raw, unfiltered text. Don't try to "NVC-ify" your input — that's its job.
- **Feelings are not thoughts.** "I feel ignored" is actually a judgment about someone else's behavior. The tool will help you find the real feeling underneath (maybe hurt, or loneliness).
- **Needs are universal.** Everyone shares the same fundamental needs — connection, autonomy, meaning, safety, etc. NVC helps you see that conflicts are usually about strategies, not needs.
- **Requests, not demands.** A genuine request means you're okay hearing "no." If you're not, it's a demand — and the tool will gently point that out.
